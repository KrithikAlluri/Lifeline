# Lifeline Documentation

> **Blood Testing, Anywhere. Under $100.**

Welcome to the complete documentation for Lifeline, an edge-powered blood testing kit with multimodal AI interpretation. This documentation provides everything you need to build, set up, and operate your own Lifeline device.

## Project Overview

Lifeline is an edge-powered blood testing kit that uses colorimetric and electrochemical assays for key biomarkers, paired with a fine-tuned Gemma 3n multimodal model running fully on-device. The platform interprets results with user-provided lifestyle context, presenting easy-to-understand, medically-informed explanations.

### What Lifeline Solves
