# μPAD Fabrication Protocols

Instructions for creating microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) for colorimetric sensing.

## Materials

- Whatman #1 filter paper (A4 sheets)
- Conductive ink pen (silver/carbon)
- Scissors, ruler, permanent marker
- Pipettes, gloves, alcohol wipes
- Reagents or indicator chemicals

## Step-by-Step Fabrication

1. **Design:** Draw fluidic channels and detection zones on filter paper using a permanent marker or digital layout.
2. **Patterning:** Use conductive ink pen to define test circuits or electrodes as needed.
3. **Cutting:** Trim μPADs to desired size and shape.
4. **Sterilization:** Wipe tools and workspace with alcohol prior to fabrication.
5. **Reagent Loading:** Spot detection zones with required reagent, allow to dry.

## Usage Notes

- Store μPADs in a dry, dark environment to preserve sensitivity.
- Use disposable gloves and pipettes for sample handling.
